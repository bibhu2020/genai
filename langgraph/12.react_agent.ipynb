    "### ReAct Agent\n",
    "A ReAct agent is a very common type AI agent that uses a \"reasoning and acting\" (ReAct) framework to combine chain-of-thought (CoT) reasoning with the ability to use external tools. This framework enhances the ability of large language models (LLMs) to handle complex tasks and decision-making. \n",
    "\n",
    "**How it works?**\n",
    "1. Reasoning (Thinking): The agent analyzes the input and determines the next steps.\n",
    "\n",
    "2. Action: Based on the reasoning, the agent selects and executes the tool or logic to perform a specific task.\n",
    "\n",
    "3. Observation (Feedback): Agent examines the result of the Action, and uses the information to refine its reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "4. Iteration: The step1-3 is repeated until a satisfactory result is achieved.\n",
