    "# üìà Building a GenAI-Powered Investment Planning Assistant\n",
    "\n",
    "![Financial Assistant](images/agent.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "In the world of financial advising, providing personalized, up-to-date investment advice is a significant challenge. With the rise of **Generative AI (GenAI)**, we now have the components to build smarter, more efficient financial planning applications. This guide explores how to leverage **LLMs**, **RAG**, **Tools**, **Functions**, and **Agents** to create an intelligent investment planning assistant.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 1. üß† The LLM (Large Language Model): The Conversational Engine\n",
    "\n",
    "The **LLM** is the brain of the operation. It's the component that directly interacts with the user, understands their questions in natural language, and provides explanations.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **What it does:** Handles conversations, explains financial concepts (e.g., \"What is risk tolerance?\").\n",
    "-   **Limitation:** Its knowledge is static and based on past data. It doesn't know what's happening in the market *right now*.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example:**\n",
    "> **User:** \"I want to save for retirement. Can you help me?\"\n",
    "> **LLM:** \"Absolutely! To get started, how old are you, and when do you plan to retire?\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 2. üìö RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation): The Knowledge Expert\n",
    "\n",
    "To overcome the LLM's static knowledge, we use **RAG**. It connects the LLM to external knowledge bases, allowing it to retrieve relevant, up-to-date, or proprietary information.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **What it does:** Fetches specific data from your documents, databases, or other sources to provide contextually accurate answers.\n",
    "-   **Limitation:** RAG is for retrieving information, not for performing actions or calculations.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example:**\n",
    "> **User:** \"How has the XYZ Mutual Fund performed over the last 5 years?\"\n",
    "> **RAG System:** *Retrieves historical performance data* and provides it to the LLM.\n",
    "> **LLM Response:** \"The XYZ Mutual Fund has delivered an average annual return of 7.5% over the past five years.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 3. üõ†Ô∏è Tools: The Action Takers\n",
    "\n",
    "**Tools** are what give the agent hands. They are specialized functions that interact with the outside world to perform actions or get real-time data.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **What they do:** Fetch live stock prices, execute trades, or connect to external APIs (like Plaid for bank data or a brokerage for trading).\n",
    "-   **Limitation:** Tools are single-purpose; they don't manage conversations or complex logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example:**\n",
    "> **User:** \"What is the current price of Tesla stock?\"\n",
    "> **System:** The agent uses a `get_stock_price` tool.\n",
    "> **LLM Response:** \"The current price of Tesla (TSLA) is $245.67.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 4. ‚ûó Functions: The Calculators\n",
    "\n",
    "**Functions** are the internal logic units that perform specific calculations or business logic.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **What they do:** Calculate investment returns, assess portfolio risk, project future growth.\n",
    "-   **Limitation:** Functions are self-contained; they don't interact with external systems or manage the overall workflow.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example:**\n",
    "> **User:** \"If I invest $5,000 at a 7% annual return, how much will I have in 10 years?\"\n",
    "> **System:** The agent calls a `calculate_future_value` function.\n",
    "> **LLM Response:** \"Your $5,000 investment will grow to approximately $9,835.76 in 10 years.\"\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## 5. ü§ñ The Agent: The Orchestrator\n",
    "\n",
    "The **Agent** is the conductor of the orchestra. It uses the LLM as its reasoning engine to decide which component to use and when. It manages the entire workflow to fulfill the user's request.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **What it does:** Communicates with the user, decides whether to use RAG, a Tool, or a Function, and coordinates the steps to achieve a goal.\n",
    "-   **Limitation:** The agent itself doesn't perform the tasks; it delegates them.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Example:**\n",
    "> **User:** \"Help me build a retirement portfolio. I have $10,000 and a moderate risk tolerance.\"\n",
    "> **The Agent's Process:**\n",
    "> 1.  **Talk to User (LLM):** Ask clarifying questions (age, retirement date).\n",
    "> 2.  **Research (RAG):** Retrieve information on suitable low-cost index funds.\n",
    "> 3.  **Analyze (Function):** Calculate a projected asset allocation (e.g., 60% stocks, 40% bonds).\n",
    "> 4.  **Get Live Data (Tool):** Fetch the current prices of the selected funds.\n",
    "> 5.  **Present Plan (LLM):** Generate a personalized investment plan for the user.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## üîÑ Putting It All Together: The Workflow\n",
    "\n",
    "Here‚Äôs how the components collaborate to create our intelligent assistant:\n",
    "\n",
    "```mermaid\n",
    "graph TD\n",
    "    A[User Request] --> B{Agent};\n",
    "    B -- \"I need to understand the user\" --> C[üß† LLM];\n",
    "    C -- \"I need specific fund data\" --> D[üìö RAG];\n",
    "    D -- \"Here is the fund data\" --> C;\n",
    "    C -- \"I need to calculate returns\" --> E[‚ûó Function];\n",
    "    E -- \"Here are the calculations\" --> C;\n",
    "    C -- \"I need a real-time stock price\" --> F[üõ†Ô∏è Tool];\n",
    "    F -- \"Here is the live price\" --> C;\n",
    "    C -- \"I have everything I need\" --> B;\n",
    "    B -- \"Here is your personalized plan\" --> G[Final Response];\n",
    "```\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ÁµêË´ñ\n",
    "\n",
    "By intelligently combining **LLMs**, **RAG**, **Tools**, and **Functions** under the direction of an **Agent**, we can build a powerful and dynamic investment planning assistant. Each component plays a crucial, distinct role, creating a system that is far more capable than the sum of its parts. The result is a personalized, responsive, and intelligent application that can empower users to achieve their financial goals."
