    "# üìö Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)\n",
    "\n",
    "![RAG](images/RAG.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** is a powerful technique that enhances Generative AI by allowing it to answer queries using information from your organization's private documents and databases.\n",
    "\n",
    "### How RAG Works\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **üîç Retrieval:** When a user asks a question, the system first retrieves the most relevant documents from your knowledge base.\n",
    "2.  **‚ûï Augmentation:** The content of these retrieved documents is then combined with the user's original prompt.\n",
    "3.  **‚úçÔ∏è Generation:** Finally, the Large Language Model (LLM) generates a comprehensive answer based on the augmented prompt, ensuring the response is grounded in your specific data.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ‚òÅÔ∏è How to Achieve RAG with Azure\n",
    "\n",
    "**Azure AI Search** is a proven solution for the information retrieval step in a RAG architecture. It provides powerful indexing and querying capabilities, all within the secure and scalable Azure cloud. It can connect to various data sources, including files in Azure Storage or databases like Azure SQL and Cosmos DB.\n",
    "\n",
    "![Azure RAG](images/AzureRAG.png)\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ù§Ô∏è The Heart of RAG: Vector Embeddings\n",
    "\n",
    "**Vector embeddings** are numerical representations of data (like words, sentences, or images) that capture their semantic meaning. This allows the system to find documents that are conceptually similar to a user's query, not just those that share keywords.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   These embeddings are generated by **text-embedding models** offered by Azure OpenAI (e.g., `text-embedding-ada-002`).\n",
    "\n",
    "### üíæ Embedding Data Store Options in Azure\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Azure AI Search:** Ideal for combining full-text search with vector similarity search. It offers built-in indexing, scoring, and traditional keyword-based search.\n",
    "-   **Azure Cosmos DB:** A globally distributed database perfect for high availability and scalability. It provides Approximate Nearest Neighbor (ANN) indexing for fast vector queries.\n",
    "-   **Azure Cache for Redis:** Suitable for applications requiring rapid, low-latency search capabilities.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üõ†Ô∏è Azure Resources Setup Needed\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Storage Account:** To store your source documents.\n",
    "2.  **User-Managed Identity:** For secure, passwordless authentication (e.g., `genaipocmi`).\n",
    "3.  **RBAC Role Assignment:** Assign the \"Storage Blob Data Contributor\" role to the managed identity on the storage account.\n",
    "4.  **Azure AI Search Service:** The core of the retrieval system.\n",
    "5.  **Configure AI Search:** Set up the search service to use the managed identity.\n",
    "6.  **Create Data Source:** In the search service, create a data source that points to your storage container.\n",
    "7.  **Import and Index Data:** Use the \"Import Data\" wizard to create an indexer that will read your documents, generate embeddings, and populate the search index.\n",
    "8.  **Assign Search Roles:** Assign the \"Search Index Data Contributor,\" \"Search Index Data Reader,\" and \"Search Service Contributor\" roles to your managed identity and your user account to allow access to the index.\n",

    "## üéØ What is Azure AI Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "Azure AI Search is a fully managed search-as-a-service that contains only **your data**. It can index and search over a variety of content, including text extracted from images or new entities and key phrases detected through text analytics. It supports:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   Unstructured data like PDF, PPTX, XLSX, DOCX, and TXT files.\n",
    "-   Multi-modal data containing both images and text.\n",
    "-   Advanced search capabilities, including **vector search**, **full-text search**, and **hybrid search** (a combination of both).\n",

    "## ü§ï Common Pain Points in RAG and Their Solutions\n",
    "\n",
    "### ‚ùå Incorrect Answering\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Problem:** The RAG system provides a plausible but incorrect answer when the true answer is not in the knowledge base, rather than stating it doesn't know.\n",
    "-   **Solutions:**\n",
    "    -   **Better System Prompting:** Engineer the prompt to encourage the model to say \"I don't know\" when uncertain.\n",
    "    -   **Data Cleaning:** Ensure the source data is accurate and up-to-date.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìâ Missed Top-Ranked Documents\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Problem:** The retrieval step fails to find the most relevant documents.\n",
    "-   **Solutions:**\n",
    "    -   **Adjust Chunk Size:** Experiment with smaller `chunk_size` to create more focused, specific chunks of text for retrieval.\n",
    "    -   **Tune Similarity Threshold:** Adjust the `similarity_top_k` parameter to control how many of the top-ranked documents are passed to the LLM.\n",
    "\n",
    "### ü§Ø Information Overload / Not Extracted\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Problem:** The system struggles to extract the correct answer from the provided context, especially when overloaded with too much noise or contradictory information.\n",
    "-   **Solution:**\n",
    "    -   **Data Cleaning:** Remove or reconcile contradictory information in your source documents.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üìù Wrong Output Format\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Problem:** The LLM generates the answer in an inconsistent or incorrect format.\n",
    "-   **Solutions:**\n",
    "    -   **Few-Shot Prompting:** Provide examples of the desired output format in the prompt.\n",
    "    -   **Use Output Parsers:** In frameworks like LangChain, use tools like `StrOutputParser()` to enforce a specific output schema.\n",
    "\n",
    "###  scalability Data Ingestion Scalability\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Problem:** The system struggles to efficiently manage and index large volumes of data, leading to slow performance or errors.\n",
    "-   **Solution:**\n",
    "    -   **Parallel Indexing:** Divide documents into multiple containers and create separate indexers for each. These can then write to a single parent index, parallelizing the workload.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üß© Data Extraction from Unstructured Data\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Problem:** Difficulty extracting data from complex documents containing tables, graphs, and complex layouts.\n",
    "-   **Solutions:**\n",
    "    -   **Azure Document Intelligence (formerly Form Recognizer):** Use this service to accurately extract text, tables, and key-value pairs from complex documents.\n",
    "    -   **Advanced Indexing:** Combine Azure AI Search with other tools like Faiss for more sophisticated indexing strategies.\n",
    "\n",
    "### üîí Security\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **Problem:** Preventing sensitive information disclosure and protecting against hacking attempts.\n",
    "-   **Solutions:**\n",
    "    -   **Azure Key Vault:** Securely store secrets and keys.\n",
    "    -   **RBAC and MFA:** Implement strong access control policies.\n",
    "    -   **Private Networking:** Use Service Endpoints and Private Endpoints to isolate traffic.\n",
    "    -   **Avoid Public OpenAI:** Use Azure OpenAI, which runs in your private tenant, not on a shared database."
