    "# ðŸ¤– Microsoft AutoGen: A Framework for Multi-Agent AI\n",
    "\n",
    "**AutoGen** is a powerful framework from Microsoft Research that simplifies the creation, orchestration, and automation of complex workflows using Large Language Models (LLMs). It enables you to build applications with customizable and conversable **agents** that can collaborate to solve tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "These agents leverage the strengths of advanced LLMs (like GPT-4) while mitigating their limitations by integrating with human feedback and external tools.\n",

    "## ðŸ¤” What is an Agent in AutoGen?\n",
    "\n",
    "In the context of AutoGen, an **agent** is a system that uses an LLM as its core reasoning engine. It can:\n",
    "\n",
    "1.  **Reason:** Determine which actions to take to achieve a goal.\n",
    "2.  **Act:** Execute those actions by calling tools or functions.\n",
    "3.  **Observe:** Take the results of those actions and feed them back to the LLM.\n",
    "4.  **Iterate:** Decide if more actions are needed or if the task is complete.\n",
    "\n",
    "This process, often called a **Reason-Act Loop**, allows agents to tackle complex problems that a standalone LLM cannot.\n",
    "\n",
    "---\n",
    "\n",
    "## ðŸŽ­ Types of Agents in AutoGen\n",
    "\n",
    "AutoGen provides several pre-built agent types that can be combined to create sophisticated multi-agent systems:\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **ConversableAgent:** The base class for all agents, enabling them to send and receive messages.\n",
    "-   **AssistantAgent:** A specialized agent designed to act as an AI assistant, capable of writing and executing code.\n",
    "-   **UserProxyAgent:** An agent that can act as a proxy for a human, soliciting input when required.\n",
    "-   **GroupChatManager:** An agent that orchestrates conversations between a group of other agents.\n",
    "-   **Specialized Agents:**\n",
    "    -   `CodeGenerationAgent`\n",
    "    -   `CodeReviewerAgent`\n",
    "    -   `ValidatorAgent`\n",
    "-   **Custom Agents:** You can create your own agents by extending the `ConversableAgent` class.\n",

    "## ðŸ›‘ How to End a Conversation\n",
    "\n",
    "In a multi-agent conversation, it's crucial to have clear termination conditions to prevent infinite loops. Here are three common ways to stop a chat.\n",
    "\n",
    "### 1. Set a Maximum Number of Turns\n",
    "\n",
    "You can limit the total number of conversational turns using the `max_turns` parameter in the `initiate_chat()` method."
