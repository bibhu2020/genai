    "# ü§ñ Comparing LLM Interaction Frameworks: A Vacation Planning Showdown\n",
    "\n",
    "When building AI applications, choosing the right framework for managing Large Language Model (LLM) interactions is crucial. This guide compares four popular approaches: **Direct LLM Calls**, **LangChain**, **LangGraph**, and **AutoGen**.\n",
    "\n",
    "We'll use a simple vacation planning use case to illustrate the strengths and weaknesses of each.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Use Case:** An AI assistant needs to plan a vacation by:\n",
    "> 1.  Finding a warm beach destination within a budget.\n",
    "> 2.  Booking a flight to that destination.\n",
    "> 3.  Trying another destination if the flight is unavailable.\n",

    "### 1. üìû Direct LLM Calls\n",
    "\n",
    "This is the most fundamental approach. You write standard code to call the LLM API for each step and manually handle the logic and data flow between calls.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **How it works:** You are in complete control. You call the LLM, get a response, process it, and then decide what to do next. Error handling and retries are managed with standard `if/else` statements and `while` loops."
