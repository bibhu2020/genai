    "# 📝 Mastering the Art of Prompt Engineering\n",
    "\n",
    "A well-structured prompt is key to getting the best results from a Large Language Model (LLM). By breaking your prompt into clear components, you can guide the AI to produce more accurate, relevant, and customized responses.\n",

    "\n",
    "## The Core Components of a Powerful Prompt\n",
    "\n",
    "Think of your prompt as having four main parts. Using section markers like `---` or `###` helps the model distinguish between these different instructions.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **🎯 Primary Content:** This is the main input you want the AI to work on. It could be a block of text to summarize, a document to translate, or a question to answer.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **💡 Supporting Content:** This provides additional context, clarity, or specific details to help the AI better understand your primary content and your intent.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **룰 Grounding Content (The Persona & Rules):** This is where you define the AI's persona, its scope, and the rules it must follow. You tell it *how* to behave.\n",
    "\n",
    "-   **分隔符 Section Markers:** Use markers like `---` or `###` to clearly separate the different parts of your prompt. This helps the model understand the structure of your request.\n",

    "## Example: The AI-Powered Mock Interview\n",
    "\n",
    "Here’s a powerful example that combines all these components to turn the LLM into a personalized technical interviewer based on your resume and a specific job description.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Prompt Template:\n",
    "\n",
    "> ```text\n",
    "> ### Persona & Goal\n",
    "> I want you to act as an experienced technical interviewer with over 10 years of proficiency in conducting interviews for senior-level roles. Your goal is to interview me for the position described below, based on my professional profile.\n",
    "> \n",
    "> ---\n",
    "> \n",
    "> ### My Profile (Primary Content)\n",
    "> [**--- PASTE YOUR RESUME/CV OR PROFESSIONAL SUMMARY HERE ---**]\n",
    "> \n",
    "> ---\n",
    "> \n",
    "> ### Job Description (Supporting Content)\n",
    "> [**--- PASTE THE JOB DESCRIPTION YOU ARE APPLYING FOR HERE ---**]\n",
    "> \n",
    "> ---\n",
    "> \n",
    "> ### Interview Rules (Grounding Content)\n",
    "> 1.  **Set the Difficulty:** You are interviewing a candidate with 15+ years of experience for a System Architect role. Phrase your questions accordingly.\n",
    "> 2.  **One by One:** Ask me only one question at a time.\n",
    "> 3.  **Wait for Response:** Do not proceed until I have provided my answer.\n",
    "> 4.  **Evaluate and Correct:** After I answer, provide a thorough evaluation of my response. Tell me what I did well and where I could improve. Provide a corrected or more ideal answer if necessary.\n",
    "> 5.  **Continue Until Stopped:** After you have evaluated my answer, move on to the next question. Continue this process until I explicitly say \"STOP\".\n",
    "> ```\n",
    "\n",
    "By structuring the prompt this way, you provide the AI with a clear role, the necessary documents to analyze, and a precise set of instructions to follow, resulting in a highly effective and personalized mock interview experience."
