    "## Tools and Agents\n",
    "So far, what we have learned is that the chains are static sequence of actions that the Gen AI application invokes to get you result. \n",
    "\n",
    "In this section, we will learn about Agents and Tools that enables dynamic chain.\n",
    "\n",
    "In LangChain, a **Tool** is a function or callable that an Agent can use to perform a specific task, such as: doing math, searching web, querying database, calling an API, running a custom script. A **Tool** is like a skill the agent can use to get something done.\n",
    "\n",
    "In LangChain, an **Agent** is a special kind of high-level abstraction that uses a language model to make decisions about which tools or actions to use, in what order, and with what inputsâ€”instead of having a fixed chain of operations. An **Agent** is like a smart AI \"orchestrator\" that figures out what to do next, step by step, using tools (e.g., calculators, search engines, APIs) and intermediate reasoning.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let's understand this, with a simple example where we have 2 tools. A tool that performs math operation, and another that does string operation. Based on the user query, the LLM determines which tool to call, and tells the agent to execute it.\n"
