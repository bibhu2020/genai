Good morning everyone,

Today, I want to talk about something incredibly simple, yet profoundly powerful: small steps.

In a world obsessed with big wins and overnight success, we often forget that every great achievement starts with a single small action.

Whether you're trying to learn a new skill, change a habit, or build something meaningful — it always begins with the decision to take one small step forward.

Think about the tallest buildings. They're built one brick at a time. Olympic athletes? They train for years, often making tiny improvements day after day.

So, the next time you feel overwhelmed by your goals, just focus on the next step. Not the next ten, not the whole staircase — just the next one.

Progress isn’t always loud. Sometimes, it whispers.

But those whispers? They build momentum.

And that momentum? It builds success.

Thank you.
