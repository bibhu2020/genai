Let me know if you'd like to adjust any part of the plan!\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"reasoning_content\": \"Okay, so the user wants me to plan a 7-day trip to Washington D.C., New York, and Niagara. Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out how many days to spend in each city. Since it's a 7-day trip, I'll split it into 3 days in Washington D.C., 2 days in New York, and 2 days at Niagara Falls. That adds up to 7 days total.\\n\\nNext, I'll start with Washington D.C. because it's the first destination. I remember the user provided a list of attractions there. I'll pick the top ones like the National Mall, Lincoln Memorial, and the Smithsonian Museum. For hotels, I'll suggest a mid-range option and a luxury one. The Washington Plaza Hotel seems nice, and the Hay-Adams is a historic choice.\\n\\nTransportation-wise, flying into Reagan National Airport makes sense. For getting around, the Metro is efficient, and maybe suggest a hop-on hop-off bus for convenience. I'll include the cost for the bus pass.\\n\\nMoving on to New York City, I'll include iconic spots like the Statue of Liberty and Central Park. I'll need to find attractions there, maybe using another tool call. For hotels, I'll choose a mid-range and a luxury option, perhaps the Westlight in Brooklyn and The Mark by Olivier Dagen for a splurge.\\n\\nTransportation between D.C. and NYC could be by train or bus, but flying might be quicker. I'll check the Acela Express as a comfortable option. In NYC, the Metro is the way to go, so I'll include a MetroCard cost.\\n\\nFor Niagara Falls, I'll focus on both the American and Canadian sides. The Maid of the Mist is a must-do, so I'll include that. Hotels like The Giacomo and The Sheraton on the Falls seem good options. Transportation from NYC to Niagara could be a flight to Buffalo and then a rental car or shuttle.\\n\\nI'll outline each day with morning, afternoon, and evening activities, making sure to balance sightseeing and relaxation. For dining, I'll pick some popular restaurants in each city, noting the price ranges so the user can choose based on their budget.\\n\\nWeather is important, so I'll check the forecast for each city during the travel dates. That way, the user knows what to pack. I'll make sure to include average temperatures and any potential weather conditions.\\n\\nFinally, I'll estimate the costs for each category: flights, hotels, transportation, food, and activities. I'll add them up to give a total estimated cost for the trip. This helps the user plan their budget accordingly.\\n\\nI should also mention any entry requirements, like a passport for the Canadian side of Niagara. And maybe suggest booking tickets in advance to avoid higher prices or sold-out situations.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the itinerary should be detailed but easy to follow, ensuring the user has a smooth and enjoyable trip.\\n\"}, \"response_metadata\": {\"token_usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 2215, \"prompt_tokens\": 2841, \"total_tokens\": 5056, \"completion_time\": 8.054545455, \"prompt_time\": 0.207307676, \"queue_time\": 0.23313477300000002, \"total_time\": 8.261853131}, \"model_name\": \"deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_1bbe7845ec\", \"service_tier\": \"on_demand\", \"finish_reason\": \"stop\", \"logprobs\": null}, \"type\": \"ai\", \"name\": null, \"id\": \"run--2a0c0772-d339-425c-89e4-a8f5609d1dd9-0\", \"example\": false, \"tool_calls\": [], \"invalid_tool_calls\": [], \"usage_metadata\": {\"input_tokens\": 2841, \"output_tokens\": 2215, \"total_tokens\": 5056}}]}"}, "status": {"message": "", "code": "STATUS_CODE_OK"}}, {"trace_id": "2a5PolgWW96qsyMpr0D7hA==", "span_id": "hltGE/swlS8=", "trace_state": "", "parent_span_id": "f4W02U2v5Ak=", "name": "agent_1", "start_time_unix_nano": 1754087344262775761, "end_time_unix_nano": 1754087347519625703, "attributes": {"mlflow.spanType": "\"CHAIN\"", "metadata": "{\"langgraph_step\": 1, \"langgraph_node\": \"agent\", \"langgraph_triggers\": [\"branch:to:agent\"], \"langgraph_path\": [\"__pregel_pull\", \"agent\"], \"langgraph_checkpoint_ns\": \"agent:4249ebca-a1f7-2309-742f-e67b3426f071\"}", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"messages\": [{\"content\": \"Plan a 7 days trip to Washnigton-DC, NewYork, and Niagra\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}, \"response_metadata\": {}, \"type\": \"human\", \"name\": null, \"id\": \"54117d2f-4433-4211-855c-de8336243efe\", \"example\": false}]}", "mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"bf7a0d177b264bd9b6c9cf4e264ac42e\"", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "{\"messages\": [{\"content\": \"Let me help plan your trip to Washington D.C., New York, and Niagara Falls.

Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I'll figure out how to split the days between the three cities. Washington D.C. has a lot to offer, so maybe 3 days there. New York City is packed with attractions, so 3 days makes sense. Niagara Falls can be covered in a day, but since it's a bit of a journey from NYC, I'll plan 1 day there.\\n\\nNext, I should look into transportation between these cities. The user didn't specify, but I'll assume they might need options. Trains like Amtrak are convenient for D.C. to NYC, and then maybe a flight or bus to Niagara. I'll include that info.\\n\\nFor each city, I'll gather attractions. In D.C., the National Mall, museums, and monuments are must-sees. NYC has iconic spots like the Statue of Liberty, Central Park, and Broadway. Niagara Falls is all about the falls, maybe a Maid of the Mist tour.\\n\\nI'll also need to find some good restaurants in each city. For D.C., some famous spots like Old Ebbitt Grill. In NYC, places like Katz's Deli and Peter Luger Steak House. Near Niagara, Top of the Falls and Skylon Tower's dining come to mind.\\n\\nHotels are next. I'll pick a mid-range option in each city, checking prices to estimate costs. In D.C., maybe the Hyatt Place. NYC has the DoubleTree by Hilton. For Niagara, the Sheraton on the Falls seems nice.\\n\\nWeather is important too. I'll check the current weather for each city to advise on packing.

Let me know if you'd like to adjust any part of the plan!\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"reasoning_content\": \"Okay, so the user wants me to plan a 7-day trip to Washington D.C., New York, and Niagara. Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out how many days to spend in each city. Since it's a 7-day trip, I'll split it into 3 days in Washington D.C., 2 days in New York, and 2 days at Niagara Falls. That adds up to 7 days total.\\n\\nNext, I'll start with Washington D.C. because it's the first destination. I remember the user provided a list of attractions there. I'll pick the top ones like the National Mall, Lincoln Memorial, and the Smithsonian Museum. For hotels, I'll suggest a mid-range option and a luxury one. The Washington Plaza Hotel seems nice, and the Hay-Adams is a historic choice.\\n\\nTransportation-wise, flying into Reagan National Airport makes sense. For getting around, the Metro is efficient, and maybe suggest a hop-on hop-off bus for convenience. I'll include the cost for the bus pass.\\n\\nMoving on to New York City, I'll include iconic spots like the Statue of Liberty and Central Park. I'll need to find attractions there, maybe using another tool call. For hotels, I'll choose a mid-range and a luxury option, perhaps the Westlight in Brooklyn and The Mark by Olivier Dagen for a splurge.\\n\\nTransportation between D.C. and NYC could be by train or bus, but flying might be quicker. I'll check the Acela Express as a comfortable option. In NYC, the Metro is the way to go, so I'll include a MetroCard cost.\\n\\nFor Niagara Falls, I'll focus on both the American and Canadian sides. The Maid of the Mist is a must-do, so I'll include that. Hotels like The Giacomo and The Sheraton on the Falls seem good options. Transportation from NYC to Niagara could be a flight to Buffalo and then a rental car or shuttle.\\n\\nI'll outline each day with morning, afternoon, and evening activities, making sure to balance sightseeing and relaxation. For dining, I'll pick some popular restaurants in each city, noting the price ranges so the user can choose based on their budget.\\n\\nWeather is important, so I'll check the forecast for each city during the travel dates. That way, the user knows what to pack. I'll make sure to include average temperatures and any potential weather conditions.\\n\\nFinally, I'll estimate the costs for each category: flights, hotels, transportation, food, and activities. I'll add them up to give a total estimated cost for the trip. This helps the user plan their budget accordingly.\\n\\nI should also mention any entry requirements, like a passport for the Canadian side of Niagara. And maybe suggest booking tickets in advance to avoid higher prices or sold-out situations.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the itinerary should be detailed but easy to follow, ensuring the user has a smooth and enjoyable trip.\\n\"}, \"response_metadata\": {\"token_usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 2215, \"prompt_tokens\": 2841, \"total_tokens\": 5056, \"completion_time\": 8.054545455,

The user didn't specify, but I'll assume they might need options. Trains like Amtrak are convenient for D.C. to NYC, and then maybe a flight or bus to Niagara. I'll include that info.\\n\\nFor each city, I'll gather attractions. In D.C., the National Mall, museums, and monuments are must-sees. NYC has iconic spots like the Statue of Liberty, Central Park, and Broadway. Niagara Falls is all about the falls, maybe a Maid of the Mist tour.\\n\\nI'll also need to find some good restaurants in each city. For D.C., some famous spots like Old Ebbitt Grill. In NYC, places like Katz's Deli and Peter Luger Steak House. Near Niagara, Top of the Falls and Skylon Tower's dining come to mind.\\n\\nHotels are next. I'll pick a mid-range option in each city, checking prices to estimate costs. In D.C., maybe the Hyatt Place. NYC has the DoubleTree by Hilton. For Niagara, the Sheraton on the Falls seems nice.\\n\\nWeather is important too. I'll check the current weather for each city to advise on packing. D.C. and NYC might be similar, while Niagara could be cooler, especially in the evenings.\\n\\nCost breakdown is crucial. I'll estimate hotel costs, food, transportation, and activities. Using the provided tools, I'll calculate totals and daily averages to give the user a clear idea of expenses.\\n\\nFinally, I'll put it all together in a neat itinerary, making sure each day is planned with activities, meals, and rest. I'll ensure the response is comprehensive yet easy to follow, covering all the user's needs for a smooth trip.\\n\", \"tool_calls\": [{\"id\": \"bfbvvyvhq\", \"function\": {\"arguments\": \"{\\\"place\\\":\\\"Washington D.C.\\\"}\", \"name\": \"search_attractions\"}, \"type\": \"function\"}]}, \"response_metadata\": {\"token_usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 795, \"prompt_tokens\": 1332, \"total_tokens\": 2127, \"completion_time\": 2.890909091, \"prompt_time\": 0.093876103, \"queue_time\": 0.226647143, \"total_time\": 2.984785194}, \"model_name\": \"deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_1bbe7845ec\", \"service_tier\": \"on_demand\", \"finish_reason\": \"tool_calls\", \"logprobs\": null}, \"type\": \"ai\", \"name\": null, \"id\": \"run--8b23c83c-a6d5-4b92-bd91-d22cc9b8462b-0\", \"example\": false, \"tool_calls\": [{\"name\": \"search_attractions\", \"args\": {\"place\": \"Washington D.C.\"}, \"id\": \"bfbvvyvhq\", \"type\": \"tool_call\"}], \"invalid_tool_calls\": [], \"usage_metadata\": {\"input_tokens\": 1332, \"output_tokens\": 795, \"total_tokens\": 2127}}, {\"content\": \"Following are the attractions of Washington D.C. as suggested by Google: 1.

Let me know if you'd like to adjust any part of the plan!\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"reasoning_content\": \"Okay, so the user wants me to plan a 7-day trip to Washington D.C., New York, and Niagara. Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out how many days to spend in each city. Since it's a 7-day trip, I'll split it into 3 days in Washington D.C., 2 days in New York, and 2 days at Niagara Falls. That adds up to 7 days total.\\n\\nNext, I'll start with Washington D.C. because it's the first destination. I remember the user provided a list of attractions there. I'll pick the top ones like the National Mall, Lincoln Memorial, and the Smithsonian Museum. For hotels, I'll suggest a mid-range option and a luxury one. The Washington Plaza Hotel seems nice, and the Hay-Adams is a historic choice.\\n\\nTransportation-wise, flying into Reagan National Airport makes sense. For getting around, the Metro is efficient, and maybe suggest a hop-on hop-off bus for convenience. I'll include the cost for the bus pass.\\n\\nMoving on to New York City, I'll include iconic spots like the Statue of Liberty and Central Park. I'll need to find attractions there, maybe using another tool call. For hotels, I'll choose a mid-range and a luxury option, perhaps the Westlight in Brooklyn and The Mark by Olivier Dagen for a splurge.\\n\\nTransportation between D.C. and NYC could be by train or bus, but flying might be quicker. I'll check the Acela Express as a comfortable option. In NYC, the Metro is the way to go, so I'll include a MetroCard cost.\\n\\nFor Niagara Falls, I'll focus on both the American and Canadian sides. The Maid of the Mist is a must-do, so I'll include that. Hotels like The Giacomo and The Sheraton on the Falls seem good options. Transportation from NYC to Niagara could be a flight to Buffalo and then a rental car or shuttle.\\n\\nI'll outline each day with morning, afternoon, and evening activities, making sure to balance sightseeing and relaxation. For dining, I'll pick some popular restaurants in each city, noting the price ranges so the user can choose based on their budget.\\n\\nWeather is important, so I'll check the forecast for each city during the travel dates. That way, the user knows what to pack. I'll make sure to include average temperatures and any potential weather conditions.\\n\\nFinally, I'll estimate the costs for each category: flights, hotels, transportation, food, and activities. I'll add them up to give a total estimated cost for the trip. This helps the user plan their budget accordingly.\\n\\nI should also mention any entry requirements, like a passport for the Canadian side of Niagara. And maybe suggest booking tickets in advance to avoid higher prices or sold-out situations.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the itinerary should be detailed but easy to follow, ensuring the user has a smooth and enjoyable trip.\\n\"}, \"response_metadata\": {\"token_usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 2215, \"prompt_tokens\": 2841, \"total_tokens\": 5056, \"completion_time\": 8.054545455, \"prompt_time\": 0.207307676, \"queue_time\": 0.23313477300000002, \"total_time\": 8.261853131}, \"model_name\": \"deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_1bbe7845ec\", \"service_tier\": \"on_demand\", \"finish_reason\": \"stop\", \"logprobs\": null}, \"type\": \"ai\", \"name\": null, \"id\": \"run--2a0c0772-d339-425c-89e4-a8f5609d1dd9-0\"}}]], \"llm_output\": {\"token_usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 2215, \"prompt_tokens\": 2841, \"total_tokens\": 5056, \"completion_time\": 8.054545455, \"prompt_time\": 0.207307676, \"queue_time\": 0.23313477300000002, \"total_time\": 8.261853131}, \"model_name\": \"deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_1bbe7845ec\", \"service_tier\": \"on_demand\"}, \"run\": null, \"type\": \"LLMResult\"}"}, "status": {"message": "", "code": "STATUS_CODE_OK"}}, {"trace_id": "2a5PolgWW96qsyMpr0D7hA==", "span_id": "AnnnjlvJLUo=", "trace_state": "", "parent_span_id": "J+nMBCrgQjU=", "name": "should_continue_2", "start_time_unix_nano": 1754087361154344673, "end_time_unix_nano": 1754087361156153939, "attributes": {"mlflow.spanType": "\"CHAIN\"", "metadata": "{\"langgraph_step\": 3, \"langgraph_node\": \"agent\", \"langgraph_triggers\": [\"branch:to:agent\"], \"langgraph_path\": [\"__pregel_pull\", \"agent\"], \"langgraph_checkpoint_ns\": \"agent:84be41bb-e032-8cd3-aa2a-906369276103\"}", "mlflow.spanInputs": "{\"messages\": [{\"content\": \"Plan a 7 days trip to Washnigton-DC, NewYork, and Niagra\", \"additional_kwargs\": {}, \"response_metadata\": {}, \"type\": \"human\", \"name\": null, \"id\": \"54117d2f-4433-4211-855c-de8336243efe\", \"example\": false}, {\"content\": \"Let me help plan your trip to Washington D.C., New York, and Niagara Falls.

Let me break this down step by step.\\n\\nFirst, I'll figure out how to split the days between the three cities. Washington D.C. has a lot to offer, so maybe 3 days there. New York City is packed with attractions, so 3 days makes sense. Niagara Falls can be covered in a day, but since it's a bit of a journey from NYC, I'll plan 1 day there.\\n\\nNext, I should look into transportation between these cities. The user didn't specify, but I'll assume they might need options. Trains like Amtrak are convenient for D.C. to NYC, and then maybe a flight or bus to Niagara. I'll include that info.\\n\\nFor each city, I'll gather attractions. In D.C., the National Mall, museums, and monuments are must-sees. NYC has iconic spots like the Statue of Liberty, Central Park, and Broadway. Niagara Falls is all about the falls, maybe a Maid of the Mist tour.\\n\\nI'll also need to find some good restaurants in each city. For D.C., some famous spots like Old Ebbitt Grill. In NYC, places like Katz's Deli and Peter Luger Steak House. Near Niagara, Top of the Falls and Skylon Tower's dining come to mind.\\n\\nHotels are next. I'll pick a mid-range option in each city, checking prices to estimate costs. In D.C., maybe the Hyatt Place. NYC has the DoubleTree by Hilton. For Niagara, the Sheraton on the Falls seems nice.\\n\\nWeather is important too. I'll check the current weather for each city to advise on packing. D.C. and NYC might be similar, while Niagara could be cooler, especially in the evenings.\\n\\nCost breakdown is crucial. I'll estimate hotel costs, food, transportation, and activities. Using the provided tools, I'll calculate totals and daily averages to give the user a clear idea of expenses.\\n\\nFinally, I'll put it all together in a neat itinerary, making sure each day is planned with activities, meals, and rest.

Let me know if you'd like to adjust any part of the plan!\", \"additional_kwargs\": {\"reasoning_content\": \"Okay, so the user wants me to plan a 7-day trip to Washington D.C., New York, and Niagara. Let me break this down.\\n\\nFirst, I need to figure out how many days to spend in each city. Since it's a 7-day trip, I'll split it into 3 days in Washington D.C., 2 days in New York, and 2 days at Niagara Falls. That adds up to 7 days total.\\n\\nNext, I'll start with Washington D.C. because it's the first destination. I remember the user provided a list of attractions there. I'll pick the top ones like the National Mall, Lincoln Memorial, and the Smithsonian Museum. For hotels, I'll suggest a mid-range option and a luxury one. The Washington Plaza Hotel seems nice, and the Hay-Adams is a historic choice.\\n\\nTransportation-wise, flying into Reagan National Airport makes sense. For getting around, the Metro is efficient, and maybe suggest a hop-on hop-off bus for convenience. I'll include the cost for the bus pass.\\n\\nMoving on to New York City, I'll include iconic spots like the Statue of Liberty and Central Park. I'll need to find attractions there, maybe using another tool call. For hotels, I'll choose a mid-range and a luxury option, perhaps the Westlight in Brooklyn and The Mark by Olivier Dagen for a splurge.\\n\\nTransportation between D.C. and NYC could be by train or bus, but flying might be quicker. I'll check the Acela Express as a comfortable option. In NYC, the Metro is the way to go, so I'll include a MetroCard cost.\\n\\nFor Niagara Falls, I'll focus on both the American and Canadian sides. The Maid of the Mist is a must-do, so I'll include that. Hotels like The Giacomo and The Sheraton on the Falls seem good options. Transportation from NYC to Niagara could be a flight to Buffalo and then a rental car or shuttle.\\n\\nI'll outline each day with morning, afternoon, and evening activities, making sure to balance sightseeing and relaxation. For dining, I'll pick some popular restaurants in each city, noting the price ranges so the user can choose based on their budget.\\n\\nWeather is important, so I'll check the forecast for each city during the travel dates. That way, the user knows what to pack. I'll make sure to include average temperatures and any potential weather conditions.\\n\\nFinally, I'll estimate the costs for each category: flights, hotels, transportation, food, and activities. I'll add them up to give a total estimated cost for the trip. This helps the user plan their budget accordingly.\\n\\nI should also mention any entry requirements, like a passport for the Canadian side of Niagara. And maybe suggest booking tickets in advance to avoid higher prices or sold-out situations.\\n\\nPutting it all together, the itinerary should be detailed but easy to follow, ensuring the user has a smooth and enjoyable trip.\\n\"}, \"response_metadata\": {\"token_usage\": {\"completion_tokens\": 2215, \"prompt_tokens\": 2841, \"total_tokens\": 5056, \"completion_time\": 8.054545455, \"prompt_time\": 0.207307676, \"queue_time\": 0.23313477300000002, \"total_time\": 8.261853131}, \"model_name\": \"deepseek-r1-distill-llama-70b\", \"system_fingerprint\": \"fp_1bbe7845ec\", \"service_tier\": \"on_demand\", \"finish_reason\": \"stop\", \"logprobs\": null}, \"type\": \"ai\", \"name\": null, \"id\": \"run--2a0c0772-d339-425c-89e4-a8f5609d1dd9-0\", \"example\": false, \"tool_calls\": [], \"invalid_tool_calls\": [], \"usage_metadata\": {\"input_tokens\": 2841, \"output_tokens\": 2215, \"total_tokens\": 5056}}]}", "mlflow.traceRequestId": "\"bf7a0d177b264bd9b6c9cf4e264ac42e\"", "mlflow.spanOutputs": "\"end\""}, "status": {"message": "", "code": "STATUS_CODE_OK"}}]}
