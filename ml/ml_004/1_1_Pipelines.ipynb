        "As an ML practitioner, you are probably familiar with building ML models using Scikit-learn, PyTorch, TensorFlow, or similar. An **[ML Pipeline](https://docs.zenml.io/user-guide/starter-guide)** is simply an extension, including other steps you would typically do before or after building a model, like data acquisition, preprocessing, model deployment, or monitoring. The ML pipeline essentially defines a step-by-step procedure of your work as an ML practitioner. Defining ML pipelines explicitly in code is great because:\n",
