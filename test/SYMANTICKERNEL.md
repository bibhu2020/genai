# SYMANTIC KERNEL (SK)
Semantic Kernel (SK) is an open-source SDK from Microsoft that helps you integrate LLMs (like Azure OpenAI or OpenAI) into your apps using concepts like:
    - 🧩 Plugins: Wrap APIs or functions to be used by the LLM.
    - 📄 Semantic Functions: Prompt templates turned into callable functions.
    - 🔗 Planners: Let LLMs decide which functions/tools to call to solve complex goals.
    - 🧠 Memory: Built-in support for vector-based memory (e.g., using Azure Cognitive Search or Redis).
    - Agents = Pluggins + Planner + Memory

# Lagchain
LangChain is a Python and JavaScript framework that provides:
    - 🔌 Tools/Chains: Composable "chains" of prompts and logic.
    - 🔍 Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG): Built-in support for vector stores and context injection.
    - 🧠 Agents: LLMs that reason and call tools/plugins.
    - ⚡ Integrations: Many providers (OpenAI, Cohere, Hugging Face, Pinecone, etc.).
